# Web Scraping Application
This repository contains the code for a web scraping application with a React frontend, Flask backend, MongoDB database, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The application uses Beautiful Soup for scraping web content and integrates with the GitHub API for various functions.

# Overview
The application is designed to scrape data from websites, process it, and display it in a user-friendly web interface. It uses React for the frontend to provide a responsive UI, Flask as the backend server to handle API requests, and MongoDB for storing scraped data. GitHub Actions are configured for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring that the codebase is automatically tested and deployed to the production environment.

# Features
Web scraping with Beautiful Soup (bs4)
React-based frontend for a dynamic user experience
Flask backend for handling API requests and server-side logic
MongoDB for data persistence
GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
Integration with the GitHub API for additional functionalities
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
Python 3 and pip (https://python.org/)
MongoDB (https://mongodb.com/)
A GitHub account for setting up GitHub Actions and API integration
Installation
To set up the application for development, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository:
```Bash

Insert code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install frontend dependencies:
```
```Bash

Insert code
cd frontend
npm install
Install backend dependencies:
```
```Bash

Insert code
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the environment variables by creating a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:
Env
```

# Insert code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
Replace your-db-name with the name of your MongoDB database and your_github_tok<wbr>en with your personal GitHub token.

# Running the Application
To run the application:

- Start the MongoDB service on your machine.

- Run the Flask backend server:

```Bash

Insert code
cd backend
flask run
In a new terminal, start the React frontend:
```
```Bash

# Insert code
cd frontend
npm start
The React application will open in your default web browser at http://localhos<wbr>t:3000.
```

# Testing
### To run the automated tests for the backend, use the following command:

```Bash

# Insert code
cd backend
python -m unittest
GitHub Actions
The .github/workflo<wbr>ws directory contains the GitHub Actions workflow files. These workflows automate testing and deployment processes.
```

## main.yml: Runs tests on every push and pull request to the main branch.
- deploy.yml: Deploys the application to the production server on every push to the main branch, after tests pass.
